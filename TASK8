TASK -8
Data Flow Diagrams
Aim:
The aim is to implement Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) to perform the data modeling with
Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 analysis for the Online Banking System.
Data Flow Diagram
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) represents how data moves through the Online Banking
System. It shows how information is input, processed, stored, and output. DFDs provide
insight into the system’s data handling without involving control flow, loops, or decision
rules.
Notations in DFD:
• Process: Represents a function or activity (e.g., Fund Transfer, Account Login).
• Data Flow: Indicates the direction of data movement.
• Data Store: Represents data storage (e.g., Database).
• External Entity: Represents sources or destinations of data (e.g., Customer, Admin).
Levels of DFD:
The Online Banking System DFD is represented in hierarchical levels to ensure clarity and
transparency.
• 0-Level DFD: Represents the entire banking system as one process, showing
interactions between the customer, admin, and the system.
• 1-Level DFD: Depicts major modules such as Login/Registration, Account
Management, Fund Transfer, and Transaction History.
• 2-Level DFD: Shows internal operations of each module — for instance, fund transfer
verification, balance deduction, transaction logging, and confirmation generation.
• 3-Level DFD: (Optional) Represents detailed data flow within each function, showing
data validation, API requests, and database updates.
Level 0 DFD:
The customer interacts with the Online Banking System to perform transactions. The system
accesses the database and returns the requested data such as account balance, transaction
details, or payment confirmation.
Level 0 DFD
Level 1 DFD:
Breaks the system into main processes — User Authentication, Fund Management, Account
Details Retrieval, and Transaction Handling. Each process interacts with the Bank Database
for data validation and updates.
Level 1 DFD
Level 2 DFD:
Further elaborates each main process. For example, Fund Management includes steps such as
verifying balance, deducting amount, recording transaction, and notifying both sender and
receiver.
LEVEL 2 DFD
Result:
Thus, the Data Flow Diagrams for the Online Banking System have been successfully
designed up to Level 2, representing the detailed flow of data between users, processes, and
the database.
