TASK-3
To Prepare a Detailed Estimate using the FP and COCOMO Model and to
Prepare a Detailed Project Schedule for Online Banking System
Aim:
To perform estimation using Function Point (FP) and COCOMO models and to develop a
project schedule for the Online Banking System.
FP Model
The Functional Size of the Online Banking System is measured in Function Points (FP),
which represent the functional complexity of the software application.
Step 1:
[F = 14 \times \text{scale}]
The scale varies from 0 to 5, depending on the Complexity Adjustment Factor (CAF).
Scale Influence Level
0 No Influence
1 Incidental
2 Moderate
3 Average
4 Significant
5 Essential
Step 2: Calculate Complexity Adjustment Factor (CAF)
[CAF = 0.65 + (0.01 \times F)]
Step 3: Calculate Unadjusted Function Point (UFP)
Function Units Low Avg High
External Inputs (EI) 3 4 6
External Outputs (EO) 4 5 7
External Inquiries (EQ) 3 4 6
Internal Logical Files (ILF) 7 10 15
Function Units Low Avg High
External Interface Files (EIF) 5 7 10
Step 4: Calculate Function Point
[FP = UFP \times CAF]
Given data for the Online Banking System:
Parameter Value
Number of user inputs 24
Number of user outputs 46
Number of inquiries 8
Number of files 4
Number of external interfaces 2
Effort 36.9 person-months
Technical documents 265 pages
User documents 122 pages
Cost $7744 per month
When average complexity values are considered:
FP = UFP × CAF, which provides the total size estimate of the Online Banking System.
COCOMO Model
A project for the Online Banking System is estimated to be 400 KLOC.
The effort and development time for all three models — Organic, Semi-detached, and
Embedded — are calculated using the Basic COCOMO equations:
[Effort = a \times (KLOC)^b \text{ PM}]
[T_{dev} = c \times (Effort)^d \text{ Months}]
Estimated Size of Project = 400 KLOC
(i) Organic Mode
[Effort = 2.4 \times (400)^{1.05} = 1295.31 \text{ PM}]
[T_{dev} = 2.5 \times (1295.31)^{0.38} = 38.07 \text{ Months}]
(ii) Semi-Detached Mode
[Effort = 3.0 \times (400)^{1.12} = 2462.79 \text{ PM}]
[T_{dev} = 2.5 \times (2462.79)^{0.35} = 38.45 \text{ Months}]
(iii) Embedded Mode
[Effort = 3.6 \times (400)^{1.20} = 4772.81 \text{ PM}]
[T_{dev} = 2.5 \times (4772.81)^{0.32} = 38.00 \text{ Months}]
Project Scheduling
A project schedule is a detailed timetable that defines the sequence of tasks, responsible
resources, and deadlines required to complete the Online Banking System efficiently.
Phase Activities Duration
Requirement
Analysis Collect user requirements and system goals 2 weeks
Design Phase Create system architecture and database design 3 weeks
Development Phase Implement core modules (Login, Fund Transfer, Account
Management) 8 weeks
Testing Phase Perform unit, integration, and security testing 4 weeks
Deployment Phase Host on secure server and launch for end-users 2 weeks
Maintenance &
Updates Ongoing bug fixes and feature updates Continuous
Result:
Thus, the estimation using Function Point (FP) and COCOMO models has been successfully
performed for the Online Banking System, and a detailed project schedule has been prepared
to ensure systematic and timely completion of the project.
