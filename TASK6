TASK-6
User Interface Diagram, State Transition Diagram,and
Activity Diagram
Aim:
The aim is to model the User Interface Diagrams, State Transition Diagram, and Activity
Diagram for the Online Banking System.
User Interface Diagram
User Interface (UI) design focuses on building interactive, user-friendly interfaces that enable
seamless communication between the user and the system.
The user interface design for an Online Banking System aims to provide a simple and secure
way for customers to perform banking operations such as viewing account details,
transferring funds, checking balances, and managing user profiles.
The interface includes clear menus, navigation bars, buttons, and input fields to ensure users
can easily access required services.
Visual elements such as icons for fund transfer, bill payments, account statements, and logout
are organized intuitively. The design prioritizes simplicity, accessibility, and data security to
provide a safe and convenient banking experience for all users.
USER INTERFACE DIAGRAM
State Transition Diagram
A State Transition Diagram (or Statechart) illustrates various states and transitions an Online
Banking System undergoes during its operation.
In this system, the initial state is “Idle”, where the system waits for a user to log in.
After successful login, it transitions to the “Authenticated” state, allowing the user to access
account features.
From here, the system can transition into multiple states such as:
• “Viewing Account” (when the user checks account balance or statement)
• “Transferring Funds” (when the user performs money transfers)
• “Paying Bills” (when settling online payments)
• “Updating Profile” (for password or details update)
After completing transactions, the system returns to the “Idle” or “Logout” state.
This diagram helps visualize system behavior and the logical sequence of operations during
user interactions.
STATE TRANSITION DIAGRAM
Activity Diagram
An Activity Diagram represents the workflow of activities performed in the Online Banking
System from start to completion.
The activity begins when a user accesses the login page and enters valid credentials. Once
authenticated, the user can select actions such as checking balance, transferring funds, paying
bills, or viewing transaction history.
Each selected operation proceeds through its own activity flow — for example, in fund
transfer, the user enters the beneficiary details, specifies the amount, confirms the
transaction, and receives a confirmation message.
Finally, the activity concludes when the user logs out of the system.
This diagram simplifies understanding of the process flow and shows how the user interacts
with different banking features.
ACTIVITY DIAGRAM
Result:
Thus, the User Interface Diagram, State Transition Diagram, and Activity Diagram for the
Online Banking System have been successfully designed, illustrating the structure, state flow,
and activity sequence of the system.
