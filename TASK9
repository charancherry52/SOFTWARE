TASK-9
Test Cases for Both Black Box Testing and White Box Testing
Aim:
The aim is to write the test cases for both Black Box Testing and White Box Testing of the
Online Banking System.
Black Box Testing:
Black box testing focuses on verifying system functionality without viewing internal code.
Below are sample black box test cases for an Online Banking System.
1. User Registration:
o Test Case: Register a new user with valid inputs.
o Expected Result: Registration successful.
o Pass/Fail: Pass
o Test Case: Register with missing or invalid details.
o Expected Result: Display error message.
o Pass/Fail: Pass
2. User Login:
o Test Case: Login with valid credentials.
o Expected Result: User dashboard displayed.
o Pass/Fail: Pass
o Test Case: Login with incorrect password.
o Expected Result: Error “Invalid credentials.”
o Pass/Fail: Pass
3. Fund Transfer:
o Test Case: Transfer funds with sufficient balance.
o Expected Result: Transaction successful.
o Pass/Fail: Pass
o Test Case: Transfer funds with insufficient balance.
o Expected Result: Display “Insufficient funds.”
o Pass/Fail: Pass
4. Account Details Retrieval:
o Test Case: View account balance and transaction history.
o Expected Result: Correct account details displayed.
o Pass/Fail: Pass
5. Bill Payment:
o Test Case: Pay bill with correct details.
o Expected Result: Payment confirmation displayed.
o Pass/Fail: Pass
White Box Testing:
White box testing ensures internal logic, algorithms, and code paths work correctly.
Below are white box test cases for the Online Banking System.
1. Login Functionality:
o Test Case 1: Validate successful login with correct credentials.
o Expected Result: Redirect to user dashboard.
o Test Case 2: Attempt login with invalid data.
o Expected Result: Display error message.
2. Fund Transfer Logic:
o Test Case: Verify deduction and credit logic between sender and receiver.
o Expected Result: Balances updated accurately in both accounts.
3. Transaction Recording:
o Test Case: Ensure every transaction is logged in the database.
o Expected Result: Transaction record stored successfully.
4. Balance Check:
o Test Case: Validate that balance cannot go negative after a transaction.
o Expected Result: Transaction rejected if insufficient funds.
5. Account Update:
o Test Case: Test updating user profile or password.
o Expected Result: Changes saved successfully in the database.
Result:
Thus, the Black Box and White Box Testing test cases for the Online Banking System were
designed and verified successfully.
