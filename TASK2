Online Banking System
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the Online Banking System. It
provides a detailed description of the functional and non-functional requirements. The
document serves as a reference for developers, testers, and stakeholders to ensure that the
final product aligns with the client’s expectations and meets industry standards for online
financial systems.

1.5 Overview
• Chapter 1 describes the purpose and scope.
• Chapter 2 discusses the system’s overall functionalities and constraints.
• Chapter 3 defines specific requirements to design and implement the system.
2. System Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The Online Banking System replaces traditional manual banking processes by offering an
automated digital platform. It enables customers to access banking services anytime,
anywhere. The system ensures secure data storage, fast transactions, and user-friendly access
through the web and mobile applications. Administrators can monitor transactions, manage
user accounts, and generate reports in real time.
2.2 Product Functions
There are two main users of this system:
1. Customer
2. Administrator
System Functions Include:
• User authentication and registration.
• Viewing account details and transaction history.
• Online fund transfer between accounts and banks.
• Bill payment and loan management.
• Admin dashboard for transaction monitoring and fraud detection.
• Secure communication using encryption and OTP-based verification.
2.3 User Functions
a) Administrator:
• View, verify, and manage user accounts.
• Approve new registrations and loan requests.
• Monitor suspicious transactions and generate financial reports.
• Manage service configurations such as interest rates or transaction limits.
b) Customer:
• Register and log in to the banking portal.
• View account balance and recent transactions.
• Transfer funds and pay utility bills.
• Manage beneficiaries and update personal details.
