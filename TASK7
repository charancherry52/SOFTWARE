TASK-7
Object Diagram and Software Architecture Diagram
Aim:
The aim is to implement partial layered, object-oriented, and logical software architecture
diagrams to visualize the high-level design of the Online Banking System.
Object Diagram:
A UML Object Diagram is an instance-level representation of classes, showing objects and
their relationships at a specific point in time. It helps in understanding how different entities
interact in a real system scenario.
Object Diagram Symbols and Notations:
1. Object Name
2. Object Attributes
3. Links (Relationships between Objects)
OBJECT DIAGRAM
Diagram Explanation:
In the Online Banking System, the main classes are Bank, Account, Customer, and
Transaction.
• The Bank object manages a collection of Customer and Account objects. It provides
services for account creation, fund transfer, and report generation.
• Each Customer object has attributes such as Customer ID, Name, Address, Contact
Info, and is associated with one or more Account objects. The customer can perform
actions such as login, check balance, and transfer funds.
• Each Account object has attributes like Account Number, Account Type, Balance, and
maintains links to Transaction objects. It supports operations like deposit(),
withdraw(), and updateBalance().
• The Transaction object records details such as Transaction ID, Date, Amount, Type
(Debit/Credit), and Status. It is linked to the corresponding Account and Customer
that initiated it.
These interconnected objects demonstrate real-time interactions in online banking, reflecting
how customer activities trigger account and transaction updates.
Architecture Diagram:
Software Architecture defines the overall structure of the Online Banking System, showing
how components and layers interact to achieve secure and efficient operation.
The architecture follows a three-tier layered design:
1. Presentation Layer:
o User interfaces for customers and administrators (web/mobile apps).
o Handles login, navigation, and transaction input.
2. Business Logic Layer:
o Implements core functionalities such as authentication, fund transfer, bill
payment, and account management.
o Enforces business rules, validations, and transaction security.
3. Data Layer:
o Manages the database containing user information, account details, and
transaction histories.
o Ensures data consistency, backup, and secure storage using encryption.
The layers communicate through well-defined interfaces, ensuring modularity,
maintainability, and scalability.
This architecture supports multiple users simultaneously, protects sensitive data through
secure APIs, and allows easy integration with other financial systems.
ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM
Result:
Thus, the object-oriented and logical software architecture diagrams for the Online Banking
System have been designed to visualize the system’s high-level structure and inter-object
relationships effectively.
