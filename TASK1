TASK-1
Design of Problem Statement, Feasibility Study, and Process Model
Aim:
The aim is to design a problem statement, perform a detailed feasibility study, and finalize the
process model to be used for developing an Online Banking System.
Problem Statement:
In an Online Banking System, registered users can securely access their bank accounts
through the internet to perform various financial operations such as fund transfer, balance
enquiry, mini statement, bill payments, and profile management.
Users log in using a secure username and password verified with the bank’s database. Once
authenticated, users can view their account balance, transfer funds to other accounts, pay
utility bills, or download mini statements for recent transactions.
The system must ensure data security, encryption for transactions, and session management to
prevent unauthorized access. After completing transactions, users should receive
confirmation messages and have the option to download or print receipts.
Scope:
The scope of the Online Banking System is to provide customers with a secure and
convenient digital platform to manage their financial activities anytime and anywhere. It
allows users to transfer funds, pay bills, check balances, and view transaction history, while
ensuring robust security measures, encryption, and compliance with banking standards.
Feasibility Study:
Technical Feasibility:
The Online Banking System can be developed using modern web technologies such as Java /
Node.js for backend, Angular / React for frontend, and MySQL as the database.
It requires a secure server, SSL encryption, and authentication mechanisms. Since these tools
and technologies are widely available and cost-effective, the system is technically feasible.
Economic Feasibility:
The cost of developing the Online Banking System includes server setup, software licensing
(if required), developer resources, and maintenance.
However, the benefits—such as reduced manual workload, faster services, and customer
satisfaction—far outweigh the initial investment. Thus, the system is economically feasible.
Operational Feasibility:
The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible through both web and mobile
devices. Users only need basic computer or smartphone knowledge to operate it.
Administrators and bank staff can easily manage users and transactions using a simple
interface. Therefore, the system is operationally feasible.
Process Model: Agile Model
The Agile process model is preferred for developing the Online Banking System due to its
adaptability and focus on user collaboration.
1. Iterative and Incremental Development:
Features like login, fund transfer, and mini statements can be developed and refined in
small iterations.
2. Flexibility to Changing Requirements:
Agile allows the team to incorporate updates in banking regulations or user feedback
easily.
3. Frequent User Involvement:
Regular input from customers and banking staff ensures the system meets usability
and security expectations.
4. Continuous Integration and Testing:
Each feature undergoes frequent testing to ensure security, reliability, and
performance.
5. Rapid Delivery of Value:
A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with basic banking operations can be released
early for user testing.
6. Adaptability to Risks:
Agile helps identify and mitigate risks related to cybersecurity and compliance.
7. Collaboration Between Teams:
Continuous coordination between developers, testers, and bank officials ensures
smooth integration.
8. Customer Satisfaction:
Continuous user feedback and regular updates improve customer trust and
satisfaction.
Result:
Thus, the problem statement for the Online Banking System has been defined, a detailed
feasibility study has been performed, and the Agile process model has been finalized as the
best approach for its development.
