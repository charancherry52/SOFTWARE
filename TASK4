TASK-4
Identify Use Cases and develop the Use Case model for the given scenario.
Draw the relevant Entity Relationship Diagram and Class Diagram.
Aim:
The aim is to identify the Use Cases and develop the Use Case Diagram, Entity Relationship
Diagram, and Class Diagram for the given Online Banking System scenario.
Use Case Diagram
A Use Case Diagram represents how users interact with the Online Banking System and
illustrates the relationships between users (actors) and various system functionalities.
Use Case
A use case describes a sequence of actions performed by the system to achieve a specific
result visible to the user, such as performing a funds transfer or checking an account balance.
Actor
An actor represents a role that interacts with the system. It could be a person (e.g., customer,
admin) or an external service (e.g., payment gateway).
Actors Identified
• Customer
• Administrator
• System
Description:
The Online Banking System use case diagram depicts various actors and their interactions
with the system.
The Customer can perform operations such as registering, logging in, checking balance,
transferring funds, paying bills, managing beneficiaries, and viewing transaction history.
The Administrator can monitor user accounts, approve transactions, generate reports, and
manage system configurations.
The System automatically handles tasks like OTP generation, balance updates, transaction
logging, and notification delivery.
The use case diagram encapsulates the core functionalities of the Online Banking System,
ensuring secure, efficient, and user-friendly banking operations through digital interfaces.
USE CASE DIAGRAM
E-R Diagram
The Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram illustrates how entities in the Online Banking System
are related. It helps design the database structure that stores information about users,
accounts, and transactions.
Components of an ER Diagram
• Entities
• Attributes
• Relationships
Description:
The ER Diagram for the Online Banking System demonstrates relationships among entities
such as Customer, Account, Transaction, and Administrator.
Each Customer has one or more Accounts, and each Account can have multiple Transactions.
The Administrator oversees and manages these records.
Key relationships include:
• Customer–Account: One-to-many relationship (a customer can hold multiple
accounts).
• Account–Transaction: One-to-many relationship (an account can have multiple
transactions).
• Administrator–Transaction: One-to-many relationship (admin can monitor multiple
transactions).
Each entity includes attributes like:
• Customer: CustomerID, Name, Address, Contact, Email
• Account: AccountNo, AccountType, Balance, Status
• Transaction: TransactionID, Date, Amount, Type, Status
• Administrator: AdminID, Name, Role
Class Diagram
A Class Diagram describes the structure of the Online Banking System by defining its
classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.
Purpose:
• To analyze and design the static structure of the system.
• To define class responsibilities and relationships.
• To serve as the foundation for database and component design.
Common Elements in the Class Diagram:
• Classes
• Interfaces
• Associations
• Dependencies and Generalizations
Description:
The Class Diagram for the Online Banking System consists of the following main classes:
1. Customer Class
o Attributes: customerID, name, contact, email, password
o Methods: register(), login(), viewAccount(), transferFunds(),
viewTransactions(), updateProfile()
2. Account Class
o Attributes: accountNo, accountType, balance, status
o Methods: deposit(), withdraw(), updateBalance(), getBalance()
3. Transaction Class
o Attributes: transactionID, date, amount, transactionType, status
o Methods: initiateTransaction(), confirmTransaction(), generateReceipt()
4. Administrator Class
o Attributes: adminID, name, role
o Methods: approveTransaction(), manageUsers(), generateReport(),
viewSystemLogs()
CLASS DIAGRAM
Relationships:
• The Customer class is associated with one or more Accounts.
• Each Account is linked to multiple Transactions.
• The Administrator class manages both Customer and Account data.
• Associations include one-to-many relationships between Customer–Account and
Account–Transaction.
ENTITY RELATION DIAGRAM
Result:
Thus, the Use Cases have been identified, and the Use Case Diagram, Entity Relationship
Diagram, and Class Diagram for the Online Banking System have been designed
successfully.
